## Usage & API Overview

Here are some quick examples of how to use the modules in this library.

### `dict_utils`

Perform common lookups in dictionaries.

```python
from file_utilities_lightweight import dict_utils

my_dict = {'user_id': 101, 'name': 'admin', 'role': 'admin'}

# Get the first key that has the value 'admin'
key = dict_utils.get_key_by_value(my_dict, 'admin')
print(f"Key for value 'admin': {key}")
# > Key for value 'admin': name
```

### `json_utils`

Easily read from and write to `.json` files.

```python
from file_utilities_lightweight import json_utils

# Create a JSON operator for 'config.json'
json_op = json_utils.BaseJsonOperator('config.json')

# Write data to the file
default_config = {'theme': 'dark', 'version': '1.0'}
json_op.write_json(default_config)

# Read data from the file
config = json_op.read_json()
print(f"Theme from config: {config.get('theme')}")
# > Theme from config: dark
```
